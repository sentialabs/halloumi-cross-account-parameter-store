# Halloumi Cross Account Parameter Store

A custom CDK construct to manage a parameter across an AWS account. This construct creates a Lambda-backed custom resource using AWS CloudFormation that handles assuming a role on the target AWS account and puts, updates or deletes a parameter on that account. Role and parameter related variables are passed to the construct and are used by the function to perform these operations.
